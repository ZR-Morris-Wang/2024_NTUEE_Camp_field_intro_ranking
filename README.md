The program only needs to be run **once** when all the data is gathered and **put in the same folder** as result.py

## Usage
**1. Be sure to have the dependencies installed before the intro starts (it takes a little time to process)**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Use your terminal to run results.py so that results can be directly shown in the terminal**
```bash
python result.py
```
p.s. idk why using python3 does not log the result into console.


note that several csv files would be created, don't get intimidated.
